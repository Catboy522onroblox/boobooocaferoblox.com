# Training Guide

{% hint style="info" %} 
Some of this info is outdated. A new and updated guide will be made soon. You may continue to use it for the time being.

{% hint style="info" %}
**\[HOST] Claim your session on the Trello. Here’s the link: https://trello.com/b/dwh7NZm1/booboo-cafe-sessions-operations If you’re unsure on how to use trello, there’s instructions on the site. If you don’t have access to trello, please ask another staff member to claim it for you. All sessions must be claimed on the Trello.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTES: Only Manager+ are able to host sessions. Assistant Manager+ are able to cohost sessions!**
{% endhint %}

****

**HOST: It’s your job to assign roles to the staff. Roles include: Trainer A/Trainer B, and Helper A/Helper B. SHRs are able to spectate. MRs/HRs are not allowed. Once you’ve chosen your trainers and helpers, you are free to dismiss any extra staff members. It’s YOUR choice whether you want to assign a separate staff member as the ranker. However, ranking is ideally the host’s job, so I recommend that you do it yourself.**

****

**\[HOST] After you have claimed your session, announce it on #sessions-announcements on the discord server 30 minutes before the session starts. It MUST be announced with @training so that people are notified of when the session will be. You must also announce your session on the group wall 30 minutes beforehand.**

\[HOST] As soon as it is the xx:00 say :slock. This locks the server so that all staff members may join. Say :unslock 15 minutes before the session begins. Trainees are able to join 15 minutes beforehand.

\[HOST] When trainees have joined the training centre, use either :h or :sm to say: “Feel free to use our !help command if you have any questions or concerns.”

**STARTED** Say :slock.

Update the group wall when you have locked the server: Training hosted by (user) has started! Sorry if you couldn’t make it! Why not head down to the cafe for some coffee instead?

HOST: You may now announce in the server by using :sm - The server has been locked! The !help command is now disabled. I expect for all of you to remain patient and attentive at this time!

Greetings, everyone! Welcome to this training session! I am your Host, (user), joined with my Cohost, (user)!

COHOST: Greetings! I’m your cohost, (user), and I will now inform you of our rules. These rules are important to keep in mind for this session, so please remain silent and attentive!

Rule I) Please utilize grammar at all times during this session. You will be dismissed if you receive 3+ grammar strikes.

Rule II) If you must go AFK at any point, please inform your trainers. If they are not informed, they will have to kick you from the server.

Rule III) Always respect your wonderful trainers/helpers; they spend time to train you! Any disrespect will lead to a dismissal.

Rule IV) Please do not be discouraged if you fail, as we have several sessions per day!

Rule V) Cheating is prohibited in this training. You will automatically fail if you cheat or share answers with any of the other trainees.

Thank you for listening to our wonderful rules! I wish you all the best of luck! Now, back to the host!

HOST: \[HOST] :pm admins Trainers and Helpers, please head to your stations!

Good luck everyone! Please stay seated, as you will be teleported by your trainers momentarily. If you have any questions from this point onwards, ask your trainers!

When trainers have teleported their trainees - :h Trainers may start whenever they’re ready!

The host and the cohost’s duties are now complete! As stated previously, it is the host’s job to rank the passers once the session has concluded.

## **TRAINING GUIDE (for trainers and helpers)**

NOTES: The host of the training session will group each trainee to either Group A or to Group B. The host will choose your role (if you’re a trainer - you will either be Trainer A or Trainer B) (if you’re a helper - you will either be Helper A or Helper B) When you receive a PM saying ‘Please head to your stations,’ you must go to your designated training area, along with your Helper. Once the host and co-host have concluded their introductions, the Trainers are to bring all of the trainees to the area. (Commands :bring %group A, :bring %group B) During the training session, it is the trainer’s job to reward each trainee with the correct amount of points. (Command: name \[trainee’s username] 1) STAFF ASSISTANTS MAY ONLY BE HELPERS. SUPERVISOR+ MAY BE TRAINERS.

TRAINER: Hello, everyone! Welcome to this training session! I am your trainer, \[USER], joined with my wonderful helper, \[USER].

Before we begin this session, my helper will be going over some information you should know, so please listen carefully.

HELPER: Hello! I’m \[USER], and I will be the trainer’s helper for today! Please listen carefully as I’ll be giving you some information about this session.

\[I] This training session will consist of III portions: the trivia, the orders, and the trolling test! The whole session is worth V points.

\[II] Trainees will need II points to pass. Junior Baristas will need III points to pass. Cashiers will need IV points to pass, and Senior Baristas will need all V points to pass.

\[III] If you must go AFK at any point, please notify us. If we are not notified, we’ll have to kick you from the server.

\[IV] Please keep in mind that grammar is required at ALL times during this session.

Before we start, any questions?

Great! We will now begin this training!

TRAINER: Let’s begin with trivia! I will now send II PMs to each of you. Please notify me if you did not receive the PM, or if it is tagged.

Command - :pm %group A (insert question here)

CHOOSE 2 OF THESE QUESTIONS TO PM THE TRAINEES. PM EACH QUESTION SEPARATELY. How many warnings do trollers receive? Answer: Trollers receive III warnings. How many warnings do exploiters receive? Answer: Exploiters receive NO warnings. Please correct this sentence: halo, welcome to booBOO cafe how can i halp u tOdAY? Answer: Hello, welcome to Booboo Cafe! How can I help you today? Please correct this sentence: hELLo, mY nAMe is BOB! whAt cAN i DO for u on tHIS lovely dAy? Answer: Hello, my name is Bob! What can I do for you on this lovely day?

Once you have PMed TWO of these questions to your trainees, reward them with the correct amount of points. Each question is worth ONE point. If any of the trainees get the questions wrong, you may go over the answers after everyone has sent in their response.

Great job, everyone! My helper will now take over for the next part of this training!

HELPER: We will now move on to the next part of this training: the orders! Please remain patient and attentive as I go over the rules.

During this portion, I will be stating II orders. Each order will be worth I point. If you successfully bring back both orders correctly, you will receive II points.

When I state the first order, you must make your way to the kitchen behind me and retrieve it.

It’s alright if you have any extra items in your inventory, as long as you have the correct order.

Once you retrieve your order, please come back to this counter and wait patiently for the others to finish. Once you have come back, you will NOT be able to go back into the kitchen.

You will have III minutes to bring back the order. If you fail to complete the order within that time, you will be brought back, and no points will be rewarded.

Lastly, you are not required to state a greeting during this portion. That will be tested later on.

Any questions before we begin?

Great! We will now start!

Please choose 2 of these orders for your trainees. You are, of course, allowed to create your own orders if you wish! May I please have a Mango Donut, and a Strawberry Slushy (cup, ice, flavour, blend)? May I please have an Oreo Milkshake, and a Vanilla Cakepop? May I please have a cup of Fanta Original, and a Chocolate Muffin? May I please have a cup of Decaf, and a Chocolate Cakepop?

Once all the trainees have made their way back, check their tools using the :viewtools (user) command! Do this for BOTH of the orders.

Once you have stated both orders, checked their inventories, AND rewarded the correct amount of points to each trainee, remove their tools using the :removetools command!

Great job with the orders, everyone! The trainer will take over from here for the last portion of this training!

TRAINER: Finally, we will be moving on to the last portion of this training: the trolling test! This will be out of I point.

If a troller approaches you, you must give them III warnings, and then call MR+.

Your warnings should look like this: Warning I - (reason).

If there is no MR+ in the server, you may report the troller’s username to the group wall, or to our communication server - MR+ will join and kick them.

However, for this training session, when you’ve given all III warnings, you may call MR+ by saying _calls MR+_.

Exploiters (those who are hacking, flying, teleporting, etc) receive no warnings and you must call HR+ immediately.

Same rules apply for mass spammers or bypassers. Bypassing is when someone is able to swear in the chat, and it has not tagged out. They receive no warnings.

Lastly, using caps is allowed at this cafe. Therefore, it is not a warnable offence.

Any questions before we begin?

Great! When I approach you after the countdown, you must state your greetings. I advise that you have a greeting written down somewhere, so you can copy and paste it when necessary.

We will now begin the trolling test. You have I minute to prepare your greetings.

:countdown 60

Trainers, you may troll your trainees however you wish, as long as you don’t offend anyone. Once you’ve finished trolling, and once each of the trainees has given their warnings and called MR+, review chatlogs to confirm who has gotten the point for this section.

After you have rewarded the appropriate number of points, double check who has passed and failed.

If someone has failed, move to the side and bring them in front of you. Then, say this:

Sadly, you have failed this training session due to (reason). Please don’t be discouraged, as you may always try again next time! Once they’ve responded, you may kick them from the server.

When you’ve kicked the users who have failed, say this to the passers:

Congratulations! You have passed this training session with flying colours! Please follow me to the blue line, where you will be ranked shortly!

The host will continue from there, as it is THEIR job to rank the passers.
