# Interview Guide

\[HOST] Claim your session on discord.

NOTES: Interviews are different from trainings. In interviews, there is ONLY one host (cohost is not needed). Manager+ is able to host. Hosts for interview sessions have more of a responsibility - they introduce and begin the session as well as complete the grammar test. Hosts must choose their interviewers, and name them: “Interviewer A, Interviewer B, Interviewer C, etc.” It is IDEAL that each Interviewer is assigned ONE Interviewee. However, if there are several interviewees, it would be different. Each Interviewer is only allowed to interview TWO people. Hosts rank the passers, not the Interviewers.

\[HOST] After you have claimed your session, announce it on #sessions-announcements on the discord server 30 minutes before the session starts. It MUST be announced with @sessionsping so that people are notified of when the session will be. You must also announce your session on the group wall 30 minutes beforehand.

\[HOST] As soon as you have joined the Interview Center, say :slock. This locks the server so that all staff members may join. Say :unslock 15 minutes before the session begins. Trainees are able to join 15 minutes beforehand.

\[HOST] When trainees have joined, use either :h or :sm to say: “Feel free to use our !help command if you have any questions or concerns.”

**STARTED** LOCK SERVER \[HOST] It’s now time to lock the server so you can start the session!

\[HOST] Update the group wall when you have locked the server: Interviews hosted by (user) have started! Sorry if you couldn’t make it! Why not head down to the cafe for some coffee instead?

HOST You may now announce in the server by using :sm

The server has been locked! The !help command is now disabled. I expect for all of you to remain patient and attentive at this time!

Greetings, everyone! Welcome to this interview! I’m your host, (user). Before we begin, I’d like to give you some information about this session, so please remain silent and attentive.

\[I] There will be two sections of your interview. The first one being the grammar test, and the second being the interview!

\[II] You MUST use grammar at all times during this session. Failure to use grammar will lead to a dismissal.

\[III] In the grammar test, you’ll need to correct simply one sentence. If you fail to correct the sentence properly, you will be dismissed.

\[V] Trolling or cheating at any point during this session is prohibited. You will be kicked from this server if you do so.

Lastly, please don’t be discouraged if you fail, we host several sessions per day!

\[STAFF] Please do not disrupt the interview session when it has started. If you wish to chat, you may do so outside the interview rooms.

Thank you for listening to the rules. I wish you all the best of luck! Please remain seated, as the grammar test will be held in this room before the official interviews.

Alright, we will not begin the first section of this interview: the grammar test. I will PM each of you a grammatically incorrect sentence, which you must correct to the best of your abilities. Please remember to add punctuation to your corrections.

If you fail to correct the sentence properly, you will unfortunately be dismissed.

I will now be sending the PMs. Please notify me if you did not receive it, or if it is tagged.

CHOOSE ONE OF THESE INCORRECT SENTENCES TO PM THE INTERVIEWEES: Please correct this sentence: halo, welcome to booBOO cafe how can i halp u tOdAY? Please correct this sentence: hELLo, mY nAMe is BOB! whAt cAN i DO for u on tHIS lovely dAy?

Once the interviewees have sent in their responses, be sure to check them over. If someone fails to correct the sentence properly, PM them this sentence:

Unfortunately, you have failed this session; you were unable to correct the grammatical mistakes in the PM. Dismissed! (Then, kick them from the server)

:sm If you’re still here, congratulations! You’ve passed the grammar test and we will now be moving on to the interview section.

Before we begin, I’ll be giving you some critical information about the interview, so once again, please remain silent and attentive!

\[I] During this section, your interviewer will ask you some questions. You have a total of III minutes (which will be timed by the interviewer) to answer each question.

\[II] You must ask permission from your interviewer if you need to go AFK. If you do go AFK without informing them, you will be kicked from this server.

That’s it for the rules! Please stay seated, as you will be teleported momentarily to the interview room.

\[HOST] :pm admins Please head to your interview rooms! You may teleport your interviewees once you have been seated.

Please do NOT PM questions to the interviewees! The chat system has been turned off, so you may directly ask the questions instead.

Greetings! My name is \[USER] and I will be your interviewer today!

I will be asking you seven questions in total. You are only allowed to make three mistakes; anything over that, I will have to dismiss you.

Remember to use grammar in every one of your responses.

Before I start, do you have any questions? It’s better to ask them now rather than in the midst of your interview.

Alright, we will now begin! I will be revealing the correct answers at the very end.

Question I - Why do you wish to work here? As long as the interviewee responds with a genuine answer, you may reward them with a point for this question.

Question II - What would you do if a troller receives maximum warnings? After a troller receives maximum warnings, you must call MR+.

Question III - On a scale of 1 - 10, please rate how active you are. As long as it’s a genuine answer, you may reward them with a point for this question.

Question IV - What should you do after this interview, if you pass? Attend trainings to try and rank up.

Question V - True or False: You are allowed to hack at any time in the cafe. Obviously, false! Question VI - What rank would you be if you passed this interview? This depends on their current rank, so make sure to double check.

Question VII - Who is the owner of this group? Luke is the owner.

Great job! That concludes this interview! Please stay patient while I look over your responses!

(Proceed by checking chatlogs to see how many points they should receive.)

If someone fails the session, move to the side and say this:

Sadly, you have failed this interview due to (reason). Please don’t be discouraged, as you may always try again next time! Dismissed!

To whomever has passed, say this:

Congratulations! You have passed this interview with flying colours! Please follow me, where you will be ranked shortly!

\[HOST] It’s your job to rank the passers!
