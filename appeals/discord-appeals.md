# Discord Appeals

If you are banned in the Discord server, and wish to appeal, please DM a member of the SHR team.

Be ready to answer a series of questions.

DO NOT HIT US WITH: "Someone abused their permissions", "I did nothing wrong", the SHR's are very good about banning and would not ban someone for no reason.
