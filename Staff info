**STAFF INFO**
Hello, welcome to Booboo Cafe staff team.
Here is all the info that you may need to be successful here.

__**HOW TO WORK/USE ITEMS**__
**Part 1 - register**
To work here at Booboo Cafe, just hope down to the Cafe! There, you can walk to the opening where the register is. You should be able to walk through as a staff member. Once you are in there, you can take a spot at one of the many registers. You can work there, and when someone comes up, you can greeting them with a nice, greeting. An example can be: `Hello, welcome to Booboo Cafe, my name is (user), and I'll be assisting you today. How can I help you on this wonderful day?`
After they notify you what they want, it is your job to get it. Go inside the kitchen and go to the desired item(s), just click on them! Once you have it, just go back to the register and click `h` to give them your items and then type in their username.
